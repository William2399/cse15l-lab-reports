# Week 1 Lab Report (Monday, January 16)

## Installing VScode

**VSCode** is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that assists developers in efficiently writing code. This editor also includes "powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging" (Visual Studio Code Website).

1. Head to the [VScode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. Download the installer that corresponds to your operating system (ex. macOS, Windows x64, Linux x64)

3. After downloading the installer, click on it and follow instructions in order to install VSCode.

## Remotely Connecting

Next, we will explore how to work on a **remote computer** through VSCode. Because UCSD features many courses that have course-specific accounts, learning how to make use of these accounts to connect to a remote server is an essential skill programmers should learn, whether it be for school or a job.

1. Open a terminal in VSCode. Two options to do so include using the Ctrl+` shortcut or clicking on 'New Terminal' found by hovering over the Terminal option found in the menu.

2. A terminal at the bottom of your VSCode window should appear like so.

3. Follow the CSE15L [[TUTORIAL] How to Reset your Passowrd](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hs7CyQeh-MdUfM9uv99i8tqfneos6Y8bDU0uhn1wqho/edit). Make sure you record your CSE15L course-specific account username and its associated password.

4. Head back to your VSCode terminal and paste in the given command: **ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu**. Make sure you replace the *zz* with the letters at the end of your course-specific account.
